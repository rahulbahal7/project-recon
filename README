Usage:
The script should be executed as follows for a single log file:
./grepForStuff.sh <name_of_log_file>
OR
To execute the script for multiple log files in a directory structure:
./grepForStuff.sh bro-logs/*/*/*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scripts:
1. grepForStuff.sh
This script contains the grep statements to search and identify the PII that 
was leaked by the app. The script has been written to look for the following 
information:
Device Information: OS, Version, Build, IMEI, MAC, Advertiser ID
Personal Information: Name, sex, username, password, email, address, city, Device
Location, Zip Code.

2. fetch_url.py
This python scripts parses the log file to retrieve the host names or sites that 
were contacted by the App and also maintains a count for each host. In the end,
the script prints all the unique sites that were contacted by the App.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis:

I. Personally Identifiable Information(PII):
The following PII was observed in the Apps:
a) Zillow - GPS location, password and Advetiser ID, Current City
b) Tumblr - Username, Password
c) Southwest Airlines - Username, Passowrd, Gender, Current City
d) Badoo - Advertiser ID, IMEI
e) United Airlines - GPS Location, password, first name, last name, current city

Apart from above information, all the apps leaked the Operating System, OS version
number and OS build number.
The sharing of the information like username, password, name, coordinates, city,
sex and imei number in plain text over the network is just eye opening. This kind
of information sharing raises a lot of questions regarding the security and
integrity of these apps. On top of that, it also raises an ethical dilemma as how 
can these apps treat the personal information the way they are doing by asking 
for a innocent "I agree" during installation and I strongly have the opinion now that
our information should be transferred with a lot more security by these apps.

----------------------------------------
II. List of Sites Contacted:
An interesting observation from the list of the sites contacted by Zillow is that
it is contacting a lot of domains(some of which are unfamiliar from a first look and
it's hard to say what they would be doing).
Another interesting observation is how United Airlines and Southwest are contacting
some domains that are purely related to advertising which shows that their intent
is to make as much money and profit without caring that much about the privacy of the
user's information.

Below is the detailed list of the sites contacted by each of the apps tested.
